# coffee-machine-socketio
Project of coffee machine manager that is a represantation of client/server scripting.

## Description
I'm a lazy programmer (very lazy). I have to stand by the coffee machine and wait for the coffee to be brewed.
So, as a lazy programmer, I have client-server scripts where the server part is deployed on the coffee machine, and
I run a client on my computer. Please note that our coffee machine has wi-fi. So, I want to choose a drink with ingredients, 
send a request and as I go - the drink is preparing. I am left alone pick up a drink and go smoke with him.
I'm very selfish, so I don't let others use a coffee machine, either I have no problems with the queue of people.
